## About me
A first year Business Economics & Information Technology student at Business Academy Aarhus with an interest in international business, software architecture and cultural competency. 

I have spent 2 years studying as Information Technology Engineer at Aarhus School of Engineering where I enrolled in multiple courses involving software architecture, software design and software construction among other things. I am also an active volunteer at a cultural exchange program where I educate and train exchange students/volunteers in intercultural competency.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities, whether that be student assistant jobs or internships, where I can utilize my experience in information technology, strategic thinking and cultural competency.
